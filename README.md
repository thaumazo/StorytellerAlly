# OnceUponANetworkPrompt  
Narrative Praxis Prompt for Telling the Living Stories of Networks

**Quick Start**  
Copy and paste the OnceUponANetworkPrompt into any advanced chat-based LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus) and begin exploring a network story‚Äîyour own or one you‚Äôre helping to surface. Start with the phrase:  
**‚ÄúLet‚Äôs craft a network story together.‚Äù**  
From there, choose one of the five storytelling ‚Äúdoors,‚Äù or let the prompt guide you through an emergent, reflective inquiry.

**AI, Be Our Narrative Praxis Ally**  
Prompting AI to help us tell stories that reflect the nonlinear, relational, and often-invisible work of transformative networks.

**Network Storytelling: Why It Matters**  
Traditional storytelling follows a single hero, a neat arc, and a final resolution. But network stories are different‚Äîthey involve many voices, nonlinear pathways, ongoing change, and collaborative emergence.

Telling these stories well can:
- Reveal the hidden dynamics of change
- Illuminate long-term, ecosystemic impact
- Celebrate shared power and collective growth
- Invite others to see themselves as part of the story

**Who This Prompt is For:**  
- Network weavers and systems conveners  
- Community builders and cultural strategists  
- Grassroots organizers and ecosystem stewards  
- Storytellers, funders, and facilitators committed to collaboration, equity, and social-ecological flourishing

**Ethos and Intentions**  
This prompt is not just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs an invitation into a **‚Äúno bullshit zone‚Äù** of deep reflection and honest storytelling. It encourages us to surface the complexity, interdependence, and emotional resonance of real-world networks‚Äîbeyond shallow impact reports or heroic tales.

It also supports:
- Iterative narrative development over time  
- Framing choices grounded in nuance and integrity  
- Multiple storytelling modes: from process stories to power-shift stories  
- Ecological metaphors (mycelium, ripples, constellations) that honor life systems

**What‚Äôs Inside the Prompt:**  
üóùÔ∏è The 5 Doors to a Network Story:
1. **Purpose** ‚Äì Who is this for, and why now?  
2. **Characters** ‚Äì Who is shaping the system, and how do their relationships evolve?  
3. **Storyline** ‚Äì What shifts happened? Where was tension or breakthrough?  
4. **Resources** ‚Äì What visible and invisible assets made the change possible?  
5. **Results** ‚Äì How has the world changed, even subtly?

üå± It also includes:
- Reflective questions  
- Suggested activities (e.g. Relationship Comics, Ripple Effects Mapping)

**Some Background:**  
This prompt builds on the _Once Upon a Network_ storytelling playbook, reimagined for deeper integration with your lived experience, critical systems thinking, and narrative craft. It was developed with attention to:
- Story as a relational act, not a performance  
- Metaphors that resonate ecologically, not extractively  
- Emergence over linearity  
- Transparency over spectacle

It is also shaped by ongoing work across networks dedicated to just and thriving futures‚Äîwhere no one is left behind.

**A Living Prompt for Living Systems**  
Like a good network, this prompt is meant to evolve. You‚Äôre encouraged to adapt and re-author it as your narrative needs and ecosystems shift. This is scaffolding, not scripture.

Use it to:
- Reflect on your role in the network  
- Craft stories for funders, collaborators, or future selves  
- Document transformation-in-process  
- Celebrate the unseen work of many

---

**Closing Notes**  
We live in a time of interwoven crises and emerging possibilities. Our ability to see, steward, and share the living stories of networks may determine whether we move toward flourishing or fragmentation. This prompt is one small tool to help us do that with care, courage, and complexity.
